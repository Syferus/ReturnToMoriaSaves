## The Path to the Repository

The sacred repository resides within the heart of your machine, at the following path, waiting to be summoned:

```plaintext
C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames
```

Replace `[USERNAMEHERE]` with thy name, O keeper of worlds.

## The Lineage of Branches

The `main` branch, noble and true, holds the latest tale of our adventures in its heart. As the chosen host, thou shalt heed the ancient rites before drawing from its wisdom:

1. Before summoning the essence of our shared journey from the repository, thou must ensure the `SaveGames` chamber is bereft of previous chronicles. Move thy local files to a safe haven:

```bash
# Create a haven for thy current tales
mkdir -p ~/MoriaBackup
mv C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames\* ~/MoriaBackup
```

2. Now, navigate to the `SaveGames` chamber and summon the shared lore from the abyss of the repository:

```bash
# Venture into the SaveGames chamber
cd C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames

# Ere the gathering:
git clone https://github.com/Syferus/ReturnToMoriaSaves.git .
```

3. Once the shared lore is summoned, thou may restore thy personal chronicles to the `SaveGames` chamber:

```bash
# Restore thy personal tales
mv ~/MoriaBackup/* C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames
```

4. Following the gathering's end, inscribe the new tales and share them with the fellowship:

```bash
# Following the gathering's end:
git add .
git commit -m "Tales of our journey on [DATE]"
git push origin main
```

Replace `[USERNAMEHERE]` with thy name, O keeper of worlds, and `[DATE]` with the day of our fellowship's assembly.

May the clear path and shared lore guide thee and thy fellowship through the enchanting halls of Moria!

## The Scrolls of Exclusion

Within the ancient `.gitignore` scroll, lies the runes that shield our personal chronicles from the eyes of others:

```plaintext
MC_*.sav
Options*.sav
```

## The Council of Contribution

We welcome the shared wisdom of all members of our fellowship. Share thy thoughts through issues or pull requests, and together we shall build a tome of knowledge.

## Summoning Aid

Should thou find thyself ensnared in doubts or the dark arts of Git, fear not! Contact the wise keeper of this repository or invoke aid by raising an issue herein.
