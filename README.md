## Preparing Thy Machine for the Shared Chronicle

Before venturing forth, thou must disable the cloud save feature within the Epic Games launcher, for it meddles with the essence of our shared lore. Be forewarned, this act shall disable cloud saves for all thy games, not merely Return to Moria.

1. Launch the Epic Games launcher and navigate to the `Settings` menu.
2. Scroll down to the `Preferences` and isable the `Enable Cloud Saves` checkbox.

With the cloud's fleeting whispers silenced, thou art now ready to partake in the shared tale of Return to Moria.

## The Scrolls of Exclusion

In the ancient `.gitignore` scroll, runes are inscribed to shroud all but the chosen chronicle from the gaze of Git. Only the file `MW_CA0D1BEC4DB885C03B96F89B3AA5D751.sav` is granted passage through the veil of ignorance to partake in the grand tale of our fellowship.

```plaintext
# Enshroud all files in shadows
*

# But let this chosen chronicle bask in the light
!MW_CA0D1BEC4DB885C03B96F89B3AA5D751.sav


## The Path to the Repository

The sacred repository resides within the heart of your machine, at the following path, waiting to be summoned:

```plaintext
C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames
```

Replace `[USERNAMEHERE]` with thy name, O keeper of worlds.

## The Lineage of Branches

The `main` branch, noble and true, holds the latest tale of our adventures in its heart. As the chosen host, thou shalt heed the ancient rites before drawing from its wisdom:

1. Before summoning the essence of our shared journey from the repository, thou must ensure the `SaveGames` chamber is bereft of previous chronicles. Move thy local files to a safe haven:

```bash
# Create a haven for thy current tales
mkdir -p ~/MoriaBackup
mv C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames\* ~/MoriaBackup
```

2. Now, navigate to the `SaveGames` chamber and summon the shared lore from the abyss of the repository:

```bash
# Venture into the SaveGames chamber
cd C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames

# Ere the gathering:
git clone https://github.com/Syferus/ReturnToMoriaSaves.git .
```

3. Once the shared lore is summoned, thou may restore thy personal chronicles to the `SaveGames` chamber:

```bash
# Restore thy personal tales
mv ~/MoriaBackup/* C:\Users\[USERNAMEHERE]\AppData\Local\Moria\Saved\SaveGames
```

4. Following the gathering's end, inscribe the new tales and share them with the fellowship:

```bash
# Following the gathering's end:
git add .
git commit -m "Tales of our journey on [DATE]"
git push origin main
```

Replace `[USERNAMEHERE]` with thy name, O keeper of worlds, and `[DATE]` with the day of our fellowship's assembly.

May the clear path and shared lore guide thee and thy fellowship through the enchanting halls of Moria!
